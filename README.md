## TGO-Roller - The-Great-Outdoors chat-bot
This is a chatbot for the urbit group, the-great-outdoors (found on urbit at ~sitsev-lomrem/the-great-outdoors).  It utilizes the [urbit rust chatbot framework](https://github.com/robkorn/urbit-chatbot-framework).

TGO Roller runs as a comet in TGO, and responds to the following commands (rolls the dice):

 - `!rollnp` - Serve link to random National Park
 - `!rollnf` - Serve link to random National Forest
 - `!rollsp` - Serve link to random State Park/monument/recreation/wildlife area
